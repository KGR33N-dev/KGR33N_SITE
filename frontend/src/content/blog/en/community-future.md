# More Than Just a Static Site: Building a Community 🌍

Today marks a big step forward for the KGR33N platform. What started as a static portfolio has evolved into a dynamic web application. I'm excited to share the new features available to you and what's coming next.

## 💬 Interactive Comments

You can now leave comments under posts! But it's not just about text – it's about interaction.
- **Real-time updates**: See conversations unfold.
- **Reactions**: Like comments to show appreciation.
- **Nested Replies**: Have structured discussions.

## 🏆 Rank System & XP

We've introduced a gamified progression system to reward active community members. Everything you do earns you **Experience Points (XP)**!

### How to earn XP?
- **Write a comment**: +2 XP
- **Get a like**: +1 XP

### The Ranks
As you gain XP, you unlocked new prestige ranks:
1.  **Newbie** (0 XP): Where everyone starts.
2.  **Regular** (10 XP): Moving up!
3.  **Trusted** (50 XP): A recognized member.
4.  **Star** (150 XP): Shinning bright.
5.  **Legend** (500 XP): Elite status.
6.  **VIP** (1000 XP): The top of the mountain.

Check your progress on your **[Account Page](/account)**!

## 🗺️ The Roadmap: What's Next?

This is just the beginning. I have ambitious plans to turn this site into a hub for developers and gamers.

### 🗣️ Community Forum
I am working on a dedicated **Forum** section. Unlike blog comments, this will be a place where **YOU** can start threads, ask questions, share your projects, and have deeper technical discussions.

### 🎮 Game Jams
As a game development enthusiast, I want to host **KGR33N Game Jams**.
- **Registration System**: Sign up teams directly on the site.
- **Theme Voting**: Community decides the theme.
- **Submissions & Voting**: Upload and rate games right here.

Imagine a place where we not only talk about code but build and play games together.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
We are committed to privacy. We use HTTP-only cookies for secure authentication and do not track you across the web.
