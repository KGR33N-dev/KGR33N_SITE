# Blog Images

This directory contains images for blog posts.

## Naming Convention
To automatically associate an image with a blog post, name the image file using the post's **slug**.

Supported extensions:
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

### Example:
If your post slug is `hello-world` (defined in frontmatter or filename), name the image:
`hello-world.jpg` or `hello-world.png`

## Default Image
If no matching image is found for a post, the system will use `default.png` located in this directory.
